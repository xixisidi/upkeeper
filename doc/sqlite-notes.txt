My reading of this document says we need to do one of two things.

1) Handle database corruption at boot time. Not a big deal if we're
   keeping "logs" in the database. More so if we're using it as a
   source of truth for configuration as well.

2) Remount whatever partition the upkeeper database is stored on as
   barrier=1.
