=head2 Upkeeper Architecture

Upkeeper helps with launching Unix daemon processes, keeping them up,
and monitoring their status in a terminal-based interface.

=head3 Buddy Controller

After startup, the Buddy Controller rummages through the 'services'
table of the SQLite database and figures out which processes are defined
and what their desired and actual state is. Both values are stored in
the table. 

    CREATE TABLE services (
        id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        package       VARCHAR,
        service       VARCHAR,
        procrun_id    INT,
        state_desired VARCHAR,
        state_actual  VARCHAR,
        FOREIGN KEY (procrun_id)
            REFERENCES procrun(id)
    );

If the buddy controller notices a process that is down
but should be up, it will bring it up by launching a buddy whose job
it is to start the process and restart it if it falls down. As soon as 
the buddy has launched the process, it marks it 'launched' in the table.
If it detects that it is has fallen down, it marks its actual
state as 'felldown'. Configuration values defined how often this is tried,
before the buddy gives up and marks the process 'stop'.
