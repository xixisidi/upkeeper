=head2 Upkeeper Architecture

Upkeeper launches Unix daemon processes, keeps them up,
and displays their real-time status in a terminal-based interface.

Every process controlled by upkeeper 
gets a 'buddy' process assigned which watches over it 
and restarts it if necessary. Upkeeper also features a single buddy 
controller daemon which bootstraps the system and monitors its state.

All state is stored in a SQLite database, which also serves as 
communication mechanism between the buddy controller, the buddies,
and the real-time UI.

Upkeeper also maintains a collection of historical process data and 
displays useful stats on which processes where restarted, how often and when.

=head3 Buddy Controller

At system boot time, the Buddy Controller rummages through the 'services'
table of the SQLite database to figure out which processes are defined
and what their desired and actual state is. Both desired and actual 
state of each process are stored in the table.

    CREATE TABLE services (
        id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        package       VARCHAR,
        service       VARCHAR,
        procrun_id    INT,
        state_desired VARCHAR,
        state_actual  VARCHAR,
        FOREIGN KEY (procrun_id)
            REFERENCES procrun(id)
    );

At startup, if the buddy controller notices a process that is down
but should be up, it will bring it up by launching a buddy whose job
it then is to start the process and restart it should it ever 
fall down. 

=head3 Buddy

As soon as 
the buddy has launched the process, it marks it 'started' in the 
database table. If it detects that the process has fallen down, it 
marks its actual state as 'stopped', and then tries to bring it back
up immediately. As soon as it's up, it marks the process' actual state
as 'started' in the database. Configuration values defined how often 
the buddy tries to restart the process, how long to pause between
restarts and when to give up.

=head3 Buddy Controller Restart

If the buddy controller crashes for whatever reason, it can simply restart,
go through the database tables and verify that all services that have
a desired state of 'started' also have an actual state of 'started'.
Secondly, it verifies that every service marked as 'started' actually has
a running Buddy process. If a buddy process is missing (in the rare event
of a buddy crash), it restarts it.
