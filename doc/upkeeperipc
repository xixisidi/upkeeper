upkeeper ipc. how does it work?
================
Today, upk_buddy_start causes a pipe() to be created which is used to
communicate back to the parent process, the buddy controller. There's
been some suggestion that this should be replaced with a unix domain
socket, but all those suggestions are predicated on the belief that
the controller needs to be a restartable process. I'm not sure why.


Other Options
================
1. The buddy could listen on a domain socket and report stuff to the
   controller that way. This has a problem that the buddy needs
   infinite memory to handle the case where the controlller is missing
   for long periods of time (or we'll have to define how events are dropped).

2. The buddy could spit json to stdout/stderr (or to the special pipe as
   today). This would lead to the buddy blocking on this pipe in the
   degenerate case.

3. The controller could have a unix domain socket, the buddies could
   connect to this and report stuff that way.

4. The buddy could write directly to the sqlite3 database. This has
   been ruled out but I'm not sure why.
