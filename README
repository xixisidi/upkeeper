Run

    ./configure

and then

    make

and optionally:

	make check

and finally:

	make install

to compile this.

To run a quick demo, do

    cd demo
    ./demo-setup.sh
    ./upkeeper-init

then open a new terminal with

    cd ..
    cd uptop
    ./uptop

(You can get out of the uptop screen by typing 'q').

Now, in the original terminal, in the 'demo' directory, type

    ./demo-down.sh
    ./demo-up.sh

to watch the upkeeper dashboard update.
