Summary:
	Upkeeper is a process management framework, similar to systemd, DJB's
	daemontools, runit, upstart, and others.  What distinguishes upkeeper
	from the others, is that it records changes in process state to a
	data store, allowing you to more easily instrument monitoring,
	alerting, metrics-collection, and automation.


Installation: 

	Prerequisites: 
	json-c: http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/
	sqlite: http://www.sqlite.org/

	And for uptop:
	ncurses: http://www.gnu.org/ncurses/ 

	In the top directory,

	Run
		./configure

	and then

		make

	and optionally:

		make check

	and finally:

		make install

Using upkeeper:
	Upkeeper consists of 3 logical parts, the 'controller', which manages
	configuration and auditing; the 'buddy', which supervises tasks, and
	ensures they remain running during the lifetime of buddy, as well as
	reporting changes to the 'controller'; and 'clients', which are the 
	tools you use to interact or interogate the controller, add services,
	etc.

	In general, you will want to run the controller (upk_controller) as a
	respawning service via init, or init-like system. Once controller is
	running, you can add services to controller, remove services, query
	configured services, interogate and otherwise list state histories,
	etc.

	The 'upk_config' utility is a client that is used to configure services.
	'upk_list' lists configured services.
	'upk_start' starts a given service.
    'upk_stop' stops a given service.
	'upk_ps' gives ps-like output for services.
	'upk_top' is like upk_ps, but in an ncurses UI (like top.)
	'upk_ctl' gets information from the controller.
	'upk' is a wrapper around the above clients.
