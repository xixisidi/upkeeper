* Buddy controller needs to run single-threaded, upon receiving a
  signal, increase a counter if another signal handler is already 
  running.

* Don't auto-create pkg/srvc with find_or_create on _get requests

* Channel printf() error messages into a logging system

* Add assert() statements in upk_db_exec_single().

* -O2 out

* Command line join: Mind quotes/escapes
