=head2 Upkeeper Buddy

Upkeeper Buddy takes care of launching supervised processes and reporting 
their status to the upkeeper database.

When called via

    upkeeper-buddy cmd-line

upkeeper-buddy sets up a SIGCHLD signal handler and forks the new process 
with the command line given. It then updates the process status to
"start" in the upkeeper database. Then, it stays alive and blocks via waitpid
until the forked process dies. As soon as this happens, it updates the
status of the process in the upkeeper database to "stop".

When called from the command line, upkeeper-buddy won't detach from the 
terminal but stay in foreground. To send it to the background, use

    upkeeper-buddy cmd-line &

from the command line or a fork() call with the upkeeper-buddy API
explained below.
